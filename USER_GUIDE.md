## Tips for Success

### File Format

- Make sure column names are exactly as shown above
- Don't use spaces in column names
- Keep file size under 16MB

### Coordinates
- Use decimal format (e.g., 40.7128, not 40Â°42'46"N)
- Make sure coordinates are accurate
- Test a few coordinates on Google Maps first

### Processing Time
- Small files (10-50 routes): 5-15 minutes
- Medium files (50-200 routes): 15-60 minutes
- Large files (200+ routes): 1-3 hours
